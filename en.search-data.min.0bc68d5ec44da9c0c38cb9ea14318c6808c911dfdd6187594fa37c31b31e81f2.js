The exam is a practical one and not a theoretical one. While I understood the concepts I was very very slow in the mock exams and was never passing. I had to make the following changes (these tips were from the course and interwebs);\n use the imperative kubectl create resource-to-be-create rather than the declarative one. memorize a few common tidbits (eg. defining a volume on a pod and mounting it at some path in the container) practice practice practice -I did prep exams in Mumshad\u0026rsquo;s course a few times and got progressively faster  Exam #  Use bookmarks #  The exam setup allows you to have 2 tabs open, one for the exam and one for referring to allowed sites such as kubernetes docs.

So, they are taxed at the same rate as capital gains.\nHowever, they are not treated as capital gains. If the excercised shares are held and sold at a later date for a price lower than the Excercise Price the loses are counted under Capital Gains and therefore may not be used to offset Income from Excercising\nIf the brokerage that is holding your options withholds taxes on exercising (this was the case for me), they\u0026rsquo;ll likely be conservative and withold taxes assuming the maximum rate ~54%. The potential downside depending on your income bracket and your actual marginal tax rate, you\u0026rsquo;ll loose the utility of the excess taxed amount until you file your taxes and get the money back.
