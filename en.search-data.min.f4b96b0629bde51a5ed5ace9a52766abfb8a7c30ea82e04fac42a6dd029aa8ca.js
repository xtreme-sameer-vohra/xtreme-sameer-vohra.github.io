It is written in the form of a letter from a father to a son. I read the book a while ago so my memory maybe a bit hazy.\nHaving visited the US prior to reading the book, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t relate to the book at all. While America definitely felt different compared to Canada, I had only seen and experienced the more prosperous pockets of America. It spoke of a life and world view that I was fortunate never to have to deal with. What resonated was the amount of time and effort an African American male spent thinking and acting on behalf of their physical safety. It is a sad waste. I could see how the institutional and endemic inequalities compounded over the life of a person and robs them of their potential.\nThe book was a very quick read and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it more highly.\nTrial 4 #  Social \u0026amp; Culture Documentary\nThis was a Netflix Documentary about the life of Sean Ellis who was falsely accused and charged for murder of a police officer and spent a substantial amount of his life in prison.\nThere are several moments in the documentary where the sole decider of Sean\u0026rsquo;s fate was the color of his skin. Its not hard to see how his life could have turned out very differently had he not been black.\nTyranny of Structurelessness by Jo Freeman #  Essay\nThis was an article discussing the issues that arose in the women\u0026rsquo;s liberation movement over time due to lack of a formal organization structure.\nWhile the lack of structure/hierarchy was initially lauded, over time it resulted in power being concentrated and promoted elitism and thereby resulted in exclusion rather than inclusion.\nIf the movement continues deliberately to not select who shall exercise power, it does not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for it.\nIt wasted good will and energy of those women that believed in the movement but didn\u0026rsquo;t have avenues to contribute effectively.\nIt created in and out groups within the movement as information/connections were tribal and not explicit.\nShe presented well crafted principles to address the systemic issues, which are applicable quite broadly. The idea rotations has been borrowed in agile/XP models to address balancing control vs mastery.\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/posts/diversity-inclusion/getting-real/','title':"Getting Real - Ijeoma Oluo",'section':"Posts",'content':"Getting Real #  These were some notes from a session by Ijeoma organized at VMware\nAlyship #   is defined in the moment, not a badge that can be worn the stance taken in the moment by a person, as seen from the perspective of the person who is expected to benefit from it  Referrals #   average white person knows less than \u0026lt; 1 black person, this perpetuates the status quo and doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for more diversity  Responsibility #   the system is broken, the onus to correct the system is on the leaders and folks in the position of priviledge it isn\u0026rsquo;t on the folks that are victimized, they may be struggling to just get by when asking someone who is under represented for knowledge/info, ask for permission first, recognize its a favor and not an obligation for the person to provide the info take responsibility for educating yourself, don\u0026rsquo;t expect others to educate you, it isn\u0026rsquo;t their job  "});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/posts/software/networking/','title':"Networking",'section':"Posts",'content':"Debugging #  Monitor Sockets #  ss\n Get all outbound TCP connections to a HOST:PORT combination ss -it | grep SOME_PORT_NUMBER  Monitor TCP Connections #  netstat\n  Get all TCP connections on a host netstat -t\n Observe the Send-Q and Recv-Q to see how many bytes are waiting to be read/written -o adds timer info and connection state    Get Summary, good starting point to see if there are dropped packets netstat -s\n  Monitor TCP Packets #  tcpdump\n Monitor all packets on eth0 in verbose mode tcpdump -vvi eth0  Benchmarking HTTP requests #  httpstat\nNAT Box #  netstat-nat\nPort Forwarding #  Local Port Forward Access a port on a remote server accessible via a gateway\nssh -f userName@gateway -L localMachinePort:remoteHost:remoteMachinePort -N\n gateway is the middle server accessible from the host remoteHost is the server accessible through gateway localMachinePort is the port on your local machine from where the command is run remoteMachinePort is the port on the remoteHost to connect to  References #  TCP Keepalive #   Purpose of keepalive is;  detect a peer who has disappeared abruptly prevent intermediate components from getting rid of a connection (eg.

So, they are taxed at the same rate as capital gains.\nHowever, they are not treated as capital gains. If the excercised shares are held and sold at a later date for a price lower than the Excercise Price the loses are counted under Capital Gains and therefore may not be used to offset Income from Excercising\nIf the brokerage that is holding your options withholds taxes on exercising (this was the case for me), they\u0026rsquo;ll likely be conservative and withold taxes assuming the maximum rate ~54%.
