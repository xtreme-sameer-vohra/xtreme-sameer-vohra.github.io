  <p><p>I was working at the Canadian branch of a US tech company and part of my compensation was in the form of stock options so I was curious in understanding how they were taxed.</p>
<p>Taxes on stock options are calculated based on the delta between <em>Excercise Price</em> and <em>Strike Price</em>. 50 % of the delta is taxed as income <em>Stock Option Deduction</em>. So, they are taxed at the same rate as capital gains.</p>
<p>However, they are not treated as capital gains. If the excercised shares are held and sold at a later date for a price lower than the <em>Excercise Price</em> the loses are counted under <em>Capital Gains</em> and therefore may not be used to offset <em>Income</em> from <em>Excercising</em></p>
<p>If the brokerage that is holding your options withholds taxes on exercising (this was the case for me), they&rsquo;ll likely be conservative and withold taxes assuming the maximum rate ~54%. The potential downside depending on your income bracket and your actual marginal tax rate, you&rsquo;ll loose the utility of the excess taxed amount until you file your taxes and get the money back. The upside is you&rsquo;ll never end up owing a sizeable sum to the government at tax filing time.</p>
