      <description>I was working at the Canadian branch of a US tech company and part of my compensation was in the form of stock options so I was curious in understanding how they were taxed.
Taxes on stock options are calculated based on the delta between Excercise Price and Strike Price. 50 % of the delta is taxed as income Stock Option Deduction. So, they are taxed at the same rate as capital gains.</description>
