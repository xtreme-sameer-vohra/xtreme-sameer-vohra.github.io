      <description>These are my notes from session on Inclusive Leadership at VMware
Diversity #   visible traits and invisible traits/dimensions of our identity (eg. religion)  URMs #  minorities - black, latam, american indians, native alaskans, pacific islanders /hawaiaans  URGs #  groups  Equity #  distribution of resources to address systemic barriers and support equal outcomes vs. equality is everyone gets the same thing (eg. notebook + pen vs laptops for devs, etc) equal is not equitable (meat to a room that includes vegetarians)  Inclusion #   Cognizance bias is a achillles heel Humility - i am biased but want to improve Empathy - prespective taking Courage talking about imperfections takes risk taking Commitment staying the course is hard Curiosity Cultural Intelligence Collaboration  In Groups #   set the rules/norms in a culture often unaware of their privilege  Out Groups #   work hard to fit in less power  Pschological Safety #   Amy Edmonson Sense of confidence that the team will not embarass, reject or punish someone for speaking up Shared beleif that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking Notice when you&amp;rsquo;re contributing to in-group/out-group behaviours  Create Pysch safety #   encourage conversational turn-taking be empathetic and socially sensitve  Micro aggressions #   they are suble discrimination that reflects painful stereotypes, practices, policies and world views  analogy of mosquito bites  1 bite is annoying constant biting over a long period of time is debilitating     admit they exist ask difficult questions show peers that it is unacceptable - call them out microaffirmations can counter microaggessions recognize that microagressions reflect painful, deeply embedded stereotypes, practices, policies, and worldviews if bias is &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo;; microaggressions are the &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo;  Covering #   hiding a unfavored trait/identity to fit in appearance based affiliation based emotional tax - the state of being on guard  intersectionality #  no one is defined by a single category  Privilege #   system advantage or privileged isnt so much about what you have, but what you dont have to think about  </description>

      <description>These are my notes from a session on Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion at LeadDev
What matters !! #  Impact matters much more than intention
 essentially not having ill intension is not sufficient one has to be accountable for the impact of one&amp;rsquo;s actions this is more significant in situations when one party has a position of privilege or authority  In such cases
 Acknowledge the mistake Make a committment to change Be accountable  Simple definitions #   Privilege = Access Underrepresented = It is a matter of #s Marginalized = Treatment Inclusion !</description>

      <description>The process #  Study #  Took Mumshad&amp;rsquo;s super popular CKAD preparation course. It introduced the relevant kubernetes concepts and the labs at the end of each section were great for reinforcing the material. At $20 the course was a steal ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. This was the only resource I used and I passed the exam ðŸŽ‰.
Practice #  From reading about the exam online and from the mock exams in Mumshad&amp;rsquo;s course, I realized that the exam is not hard but you have to be fast.</description>

      <description>Getting Real #  These were some notes from a session by Ijeoma organized at VMware
Alyship #   is defined in the moment, not a badge that can be worn the stance taken in the moment by a person, as seen from the perspective of the person who is expected to benefit from it  Referrals #   average white person knows less than &amp;lt; 1 black person, this perpetuates the status quo and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for more diversity  Responsibility #   the system is broken, the onus to correct the system is on the leaders and folks in the position of priviledge it isn&amp;rsquo;t on the folks that are victimized, they may be struggling to just get by when asking someone who is under represented for knowledge/info, ask for permission first, recognize its a favor and not an obligation for the person to provide the info take responsibility for educating yourself, don&amp;rsquo;t expect others to educate you, it isn&amp;rsquo;t their job  </description>

      <description>Drives, Volumes, Disks &amp;amp; Partitions #  Drive #  Physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Unix-like operating systems devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes which are visible under the /dev directory
Partions #  A physical storage device can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions.
Volume #  The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices.</description>
