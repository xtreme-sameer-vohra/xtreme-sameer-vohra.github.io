      <description>The process #  Study #  Took Mumshad&amp;rsquo;s super popular CKAD preparation course. It introduced the relevant kubernetes concepts and the labs at the end of each section were great for reinforcing the material. At $20 the course was a steal ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. This was the only resource I used and I passed the exam ðŸŽ‰.
Practice #  From reading about the exam online and from the mock exams in Mumshad&amp;rsquo;s course, I realized that the exam is not hard but you have to be fast.</description>

      <description>I was working at the Canadian branch of a US tech company and part of my compensation was in the form of stock options so I was curious in understanding how they were taxed.
Taxes on stock options are calculated based on the delta between Excercise Price and Strike Price. 50 % of the delta is taxed as income Stock Option Deduction. So, they are taxed at the same rate as capital gains.</description>

      <description>Drives, Volumes, Disks &amp;amp; Partitions #  Drive #  Physical storage device such as a hard disk, solid-state disk, removable USB flash drive etc. In Unix-like operating systems devices are represented by special file system objects called device nodes which are visible under the /dev directory
Partions #  A physical storage device can be divided into multiple logical storage units known as partitions.
Volume #  The term volume in Linux is related to the Logical Volume Manager (LVM), which can be used to manage mass storage devices.</description>
