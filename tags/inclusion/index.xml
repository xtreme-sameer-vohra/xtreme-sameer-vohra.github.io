      <description>Getting Real #  These were some notes from a session by Ijeoma organized at VMware
Alyship #   is defined in the moment, not a badge that can be worn the stance taken in the moment by a person, as seen from the perspective of the person who is expected to benefit from it  Referrals #   average white person knows less than &amp;lt; 1 black person, this perpetuates the status quo and doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for more diversity  Responsibility #   the system is broken, the onus to correct the system is on the leaders and folks in the position of priviledge it isn&amp;rsquo;t on the folks that are victimized, they may be struggling to just get by when asking someone who is under represented for knowledge/info, ask for permission first, recognize its a favor and not an obligation for the person to provide the info take responsibility for educating yourself, don&amp;rsquo;t expect others to educate you, it isn&amp;rsquo;t their job  </description>
